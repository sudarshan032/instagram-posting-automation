# AI-Powered Instagram Post Automation Workflow (n8n)

Automate your Instagram content creation using AI-driven viral idea generation, caption writing, image creation, and publishing â€” all orchestrated seamlessly with n8n.

---

## Overview

This workflow automates the end-to-end process of creating viral Instagram posts based on the latest news in a chosen industry (e.g., Healthcare). It performs the following:

- Fetches the top 10 news articles via RSS feed.
- Uses AI (Google Gemini) to generate viral post ideas based on the news.
- Generates engaging Instagram captions with storytelling and emoji use.
- Creates Instagram-ready images with text overlays using AI image synthesis.
- Uploads images to an image hosting service and publishes posts via Instagram Graph API.
- Fully built and managed within n8n workflow automation platform.

## Features

- Dynamic industry news scraping via Google News RSS.
- AI-generated viral content ideas with unique hooks and emotional appeal.
- Natural, authentic, and conversational Instagram captions.
- Modern, clean, and readable Instagram post images with bold text overlays.
- Automated image hosting and post publishing to Instagram business accounts.
- Robust error handling and JSON parsing inside code nodes.

## Challenges Encountered

- Parsing and transforming AI text responses correctly from JSON strings.
